            <para>
            Inline_C was written to provide an easy way to optimize
            the performance of critical code sections by rewriting
            them in C.  The idea was to allow this to all be done from
            within userland php code, allowing for transparent 'gluing'
            and compiling of extension code.

                    This command builds out the build tree that Inline_C uses to build modules
                    on the fly.  This command should be run by the webserver user, or the created
                    directories and files should be chowned to the webserver user.

                If the php.ini value extension_dir is something other that './', then a subdir
                anme inline_libs of the extension_dir will be created.  This directory must
                be writeable by the webserver user.
